summary: test basic module functionality
description: |
    The test compiles a TE module, loads it via semodule, and checks
    that the rules are enforced. The same is done with a CIL module.
    Module overriding using priorities and module disabling is also
    tested. This test requires policycoreutils and selinux-policy-devel
    packages.
